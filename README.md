### Current features

- [Wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/) as graphics library (**OpenGL backend**)
- Infinite world generation
- Spectator-like camera
- Basic terrain for now

Mostly inspired by [**TanTanDev's voxel engine project**](https://github.com/TanTanDev/first_voxel_engine) and using their implementation of **chunk-based** world generation.

## Controls

- **WASD** for normal movement
- **Space/LShift** for vertical movement
- **Scroll** to zoom
- **Esc** to toggle the cursor
